<h1>Today I started my LUA learning journey!</h1>

<pre>
I've always wanted to make games on Roblox so why not start making them, no?

Today I've learned a lot of things about LUA and I'm gonna share them!

DISCLAIMER: (some things may be wrong since I'm not an expert).
</pre>
<hr>
<h3>PRINTING AND COMMENTS</h3>
<pre>
To print on LUA is pretty easy, you just write "print("text you want to print")" 
and would be it, there's also multiple ways of printing if you don't want to use 
the double quotes (I will put a picture of them here), also, you can see the 
things you print on the console!

Comments are with double dash (--)
</pre>

<h3>DATA TYPES</h3>
<pre>
There's 4 data types, strings, numbers, boolean and nil:

- Strings stands for text (has to be always surrounded by double quotes)
- Numbers, well, are numbers, can be decimal or full numbers
- Booleans are true or false
- Nil is nothing (literally, nothing)
</pre>
<hr>
<h3>VARIABLES</h3>
<pre>
Variables are containers that holds values, for example, we have the variable var1,
and that variable is equal to "Hello World!", then if we print that variable we'll
get "Hello World!" as a result!
</pre>

<h3>(ROBLOX SPECIFIC) PROPERTIES</h3>
<pre>
To change Roblox's object properties is easier than I thought! Just create a script
with "game.Workspace.(object_u_want_to_change).(property)" and then write an equal
sign (=) and change the property, sorry if I'm not that good explaining myself, I'll
put an image here:

Then, in my example, you can see through the part:

<h3>FUNCTIONS</h3>
<pre>
Functions can repeat a block of code without having to repeat that block of code
every time.

<img src="img\functions.png">
<pre>
This would print from 1 to 10 three times. The syntax is easy: you just create a
function with "local function",
name it (for example "printNums"), add your block of code, and end the function.
Then you call the function with
its name followed by parentheses.
</pre>
<hr>
<h3>PARAMETERS, MATHS AND RETURNS</h3>
<pre>
You can do all sorts of maths in LUA, for example:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

You can also use different parameters in functions inside the parentheses to get
different results depending on what you pass. The "return" statement is used to
return values from a function (it can return a single value or a list of values).

Example:
</pre>

<hr>
<h3>IF STATEMENTS</h3>
<pre>
If statements are useful to do comparisons. For example:

This would print the first line:
<img src="img\actuallyyes.png">

And this would print the second line:
<img src="img\nahh.png">

You can also use "elseif" to add additional expressions. Here's an example of a
code I made:
<img src="img\ifelseif.png">

You can also use &lt;= or &gt;= which stand for "less than or equal to" or
"greater than or equal to".
</pre>
